      "<p>I am working as an Assistant Professor at , , since 2005. I am an , who joined the Pak Army in 1988 and left it after serving for nearly thirteen years. During my stay in uniform, I had the honor to serve in the snowy mountains of Kashmir and Siachin. I also have the honor to serve as an instructor at the  Quetta, which is a prestigious training institute of Pakistan Army. After the service, my thrust for knowledge and passion for teaching and learning moved me to one of the leading IT institutes of Pakistan - Punjab University College of Information Technology (PUCIT). I completed my MSc (CS) and MPhil (CS) both with a Gold Medal, and started teaching as a full time faculty at PUCIT. My teaching interests are Operating Systems, Embedded Systems, and System Programming. The focus of my PhD was on applying Fuzzy inference models in Operating System modules, where decision making is done based on imprecise and vague inputs, with the intent of enhancing performance and making the beast more user friendly. I am running a Kernel Fuzzification and Embedded Systems Lab at PUCIT, where I, along with my students are working on development and fuzzification of Linux Kernel modules and device drivers.</p>\n"
